  program: The Yang lab aims to understand how cells establish cell-type identities and make cell-fate decisions, at all
  major levels of molecular regulations (e.g. signalling, transcription, translation, and epigenetics). We use a systems approach
  that combines computational methods and wetlab experiments to study such 'trans-regulatory' systems, with a focus in stem cell
  and developmental systems.
