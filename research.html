        Cells are the fundamental building blocks of all life on earth. In multicellular organisms, these cellular building blocks come in a plethora of types and serve distinct functions to coordinate and support the homeostasis of an organism. Intriguingly, all cell types of an organism share the same genetic code and originate from the same group of pluripotent <b>stem cells</b> that have undergone different cellular fates during development.
        <br><br>
        Research from the last few decades has established that cell identity and cell-fate decisions are determined by underlying molecular programs such as gene transcription and translation, and the intra- and extra-cellular networks they form. Understanding how such programs/networks regulate and interact with one another in a spatial-temporal manner is critical for gaining insight into the complex nature of multicellular development. To this end, our research takes a holistic approach and seeks to understand the molecular 'trans-regulatory networks', comprised of cell signalling, transcriptional, translational, and (epi)genomic regulations, in controlling cell identity and cell-fate decisions. In particular, we develop computational and statistical models to reconstruct each layer of the trans-regulatory networks (e.g. signalling networks, transcriptional networks) and characterise their cross-talk in stem cells during their differentiation to specialised cell types. By employing a multidisiciplinary approach that combines 'dry' (computation) and 'wet' (laboratory) studies at the systems level, we aim to address the following research questions:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>How do different layers of trans-regulatory networks coordinately regulate cell identity and cell fate-decisions?</li>
            <li>How can we accurately predict cell identity and cell fate-decisions based on their trans-regulatory networks?</li>
            <li>How can we modulate trans-regulatory networks to direct cell fate-decisions for applications such as stem cell therapy?</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        Pluripotency defines the potential of stem cells to differentiate into somatic and germ cells. The bookends of the pluripotency spectrum, naïve and primed states, are well studied but the progression of pluripotency from naïve to primed states remain to be fully characterised and their relationship with cell lineage specification remains to be investigated. We use multi-layered trans‐omics approach to study pluripotency transition from naïve to formative, an intermediate state, and then primed state. We developing methods that allows the reconstruction of the underlying trans-omic networks and correlating pluripotent transition to in vivo embryos during cell lineage specification.

        <br>
        The holy grail in stem cell and organoid research is to generate stem cell-derived cells, tissues, and organs that can structurally and functionally replace any specific cell populations, tissues, and organs that are compromised by disease, injury, or ageing. While tremendous progress has been made in stem cell-based therapy, attempts to direct stem/progenitor cells to clinically useful cell types and tissues have often been fraught with imprecise and incomplete differentiation. We study and characterise stem cells and organoids using bulk and single-cell multi-omics approaches for realising their potential for regenerative medicine. Discovery made from these works will provide both basic and translational knowledge for stem cell and organoid engineering for tissue/organ regeneration.

<h2 class="projects"><b>Mapping and modelling trans-regulatory networks in stem cells and progenitor cells for understanding development, tissue regeneration, and stem cell therapy</b></h2>

The ability of stem and progenitor cells to self-renew and differentiate into specialised cell types in the body makes them the key cellular tools for studying normal development, developmental diseases, and for creating stem cell-based therapy, whereby specific cell populations, tissues, and organs compromised by disease, injury or ageing can be replaced and replenished indefinitely.<br><br>

A major initiative in our group is to integrate multi-omics datasets generated by state‐of‐the‐art mass spectrometer (MS) and next generation sequencer (NGS) from various stem and progenitor cells and during their differentiation to specialised cell types. The goal is to reconstruct trans-regulatory networks and to understand how different regulatory machineries (e.g. signalling, transcription, and epigenomics) cooperate to define cell types, functions, and fates, and to translate these knowledge for directed cell type differentiation and tissue/organ regeneration.

            Pluripotency defines the potential of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to differentiate into all somatic and germ cells.

Building on this work, we are developing methods to characterise signaling cascades, transcriptional networks, and translational protein networks in regulating the transition of pluripotency in ESCs, and to uncover how information is passed on from each of these regulatory layer to the next layer. This project will provide a unique opportunity for developing computational and experimental methods for comprehensive understanding of stem cell systems and their decision-making process.

           In collaboration with Dr. Benjamin Parker's group at the Melbourne University, we are identifying molecular controls that regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells to mature muscle cells. To do this, we have profiled the trans-regulatory networks on phosphoproteomics and proteomics levels and have developed various computational methods allowing the identification of key phosphorylation events and their downstream transcriptional regulation in controlling myogenesis, formation of muscle cells (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.104489">Xiao et al. 2019</a>). Further exploration on the transcriptomics and epigenomics levels is needed to link the signalling regulation with downstream processes. Finding from this study will have implications in muscle tissue regeneration.

<h2 class="projects"><b>Interrogating cell identity and cell-fate decisions in spatial contexts and using single-cell multi-omics</b></h2>

The advance of single-cell omics and its recent development towards multimodality, that allows profiling of gene expression, chromatin state, protein abundance and spatial location, creates unprecedented opportunities to study complex biological systems at resolutions that were previously unattainable. Our group is harnessing the power of these new biotechnologies to study how each single cell acquires its identity in organs and tissues and makes decisions during cell differentiation and embryogenesis.

<h2 class="projects"><b>Developing computational methods for pre-processing, analysing, and integrating bulk and single-cell multi-omics data and their spatial information</b></h2>

Much of the work in the above research direction requires computational methods that are capable of extracting biological knowledge from large-scale of omic data generated from bulk and single-cell omics technologies. To enable these biological interrogation and discoveries, we specialise in developing computational and statistical machine learning models for analysing and integrating these data.
