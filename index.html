<b>How do cells establish identities and make cell-fate decisions?</b><br><br>

The <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/our-research/research-groups/computational-trans-regulatory-biology-group.html">
computational trans-regulatory biology group</a> head by <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/pengyi.yang.php">Dr. Pengyi Yang</a> 
at Charles Perkins Centre (CPC), University of Sydney, focuses on understanding the trans-regulatory networks that cut across 
signalling, transcriptional, translational and (epi)genomic regulations in controlling cell identities and driving cell-fate decisions.
<br><br>
Molecular trans-regulatory networks (TRNs) comprised of cell signalling, transcriptional, translational, and (epi)genomic regulations are 
central to health and disease. 


Computational approaches are instrumental in characterising TRNs of cells at the systems level. Our research lies at the 
interface of bioinformatics and systems biology. We develop computational and statistical models 
to reconstruct signalling cascades, epigenomics, transcriptional, and proteome networks, and 
characterise their cross-talk and trans-regulations in various cellular processes and systems. 
By integrating heterogeneous -omics data with the goal of generating testable hypotheses and predictions, 
our research contributes to the comprehensive understanding of TRNs that underlie cellular homeostasis, 
proliferation, differentiation, and cell-fate decisions.

<!-- 
Systematic study of complex interactions in biological networks at a global viewpoint allows us to discover 
fundamental principles that are not intuitive and to uncover global properties that can only be discovered by 
integrating interactions between individual components. We develop computational methods and statistical models to 
reconstruct and characterise signaling cascades, and epigenomic and transcriptional networks that underlie cellular 
homeostasis, proliferation, differentiation, and cell-fate decisions. By integrating heterogeneous “–omics” data with the goal of generating testable hypotheses and predictions, our 
researach contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the cross-talk among cell signaling, 
epigenomic, and transcriptional regulations.
