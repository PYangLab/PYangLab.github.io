The computational trans-omics group at Charles Perkins Centre (CPC), University of Sydney focuses on the computational 
study of cell signaling, epigenomic, and transcriptional regulations as a whole. Specifically, we are interested in 
developing computational methods and statistical models to reconstruct and characterise signaling cascades, and epigenomic 
and transcriptional networks that underlie cellular homeostasis, proliferation, differentiation, and cell-fate decisions.

Studying biological pathways at a systems level is essential, for it is not always possible to understand 
the behavior of complex systems by scaling up properties of individual components. 
Systematic study of complex interactions in biological networks at a global viewpoint allows us to discover 
fundamental principles that are not intuitive and to uncover global properties that can only be discovered by 
integrating interactions between individual components. We use systems biology approaches to integrate and analyze 
heterogeneous high-throughput “–omics” data with the goal of generating testable hypotheses and predictions. 
Our objective is to discover critical cell signaling pathways that regulate epigenomic landscapes and gene expression 
programs controlling cell type identity. Results from these studies will contribute to the comprehensive understanding 
of the cross-talk among cell signaling, epigenomic, and transcriptional regulations.
