The computational trans-omics group led by <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/pengyi.yang.php">Dr. Pengyi Yang</a> 
at <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre">Charles Perkins Centre (CPC)</a>, USyd, focuses on 
understanding the trans-omics networks that cut through cell signaling, epigenomic, and transcriptional 
regulations. 
<br><br>
Systematic study of complex interactions in biological networks at a global viewpoint allows us to discover 
fundamental principles that are not intuitive and to uncover global properties that can only be discovered by 
integrating interactions between individual components. We develop computational methods and statistical models to 
reconstruct and characterise signaling cascades, and epigenomic and transcriptional networks that underlie cellular 
homeostasis, proliferation, differentiation, and cell-fate decisions. By integrating heterogeneous “–omics” data with the goal of generating testable hypotheses and predictions, our 
researach contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the cross-talk among cell signaling, 
epigenomic, and transcriptional regulations.
