<b><font size="+2">Overview</font></b><br><br>
    Welcome to the Computational Systems Biology lab at Children's Medical Research Institute (CMRI), the Westmead Research Hub (<a href="https://www.cmrijeansforgenes.org.au/research/research-teams/computational-systems-biology">view</a>). Our research group also affiliates with the School of Mathematics and Statistics and is part of the Charles Perkins Centre (CPC) at the University of Sydney (<a href="https://sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/our-research/research-groups/computational-trans-regulatory-biology-group.html">view</a>).
<br><br>

Our research aims to understand the molecular trans-regulatory networks (TRNs), comprised of cell signalling, transcriptional, translational, and (epi)genomic regulations, in controlling cell identity and cell-fate decisions. Towards this aim, our lab develop computational and statistical models to reconstruct each layer of the TRNs (e.g. signalling networks, transcriptional networks) from multi-omics data and characterise their cross-talk (i.e. trans-regulation) in various cellular systems. By employing a multidisiciplinary approach combining 'dry' (computation) and 'wet' (laboratory) works at the systems level, we aim to address the following research questions:<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>How do different layers of TRNs coordinately regulate cell identity and cell fate-decisions?</li>
    <li>How can we accurately predict cell identity and cell fate-decisions based on their TRNs?</li>
    <li>How can we modulate TRNs to direct cell fate-decisions for applications such as stem-cell therapies?</li>
</ul>

<b><font size="+2">Openings</font></b><br><br>
Our lab is multi-disciplinary and combines ('dry') computational methods, statistical models, and ('wet') molecular biology approaches for understanding cell identity and cell-fate decisions and for harnessing stem and progenitor cells for stem-cell based therapies.
<br><br>
Our laboratory is at Children's Medical Research Institute (CMRI) at the Westmead Research Hub. We also holds 'dry' space in both Charles Perkins Centre (CPC) and School of Mathematics and Statistics (Carslaw Building), the University of Sydney.
<br><br>
Researchers and students at all levels are welcome to inquire the possibility to join us and work on either 'dry' (computational) or 'wet' (laboratory) projects or some combinations of the two.
