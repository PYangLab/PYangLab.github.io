<b><font size="+2">Research Summary</font></b><hr>

Pengyi Yang, Ph.D., heads the <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/our-research/research-groups/computational-trans-regulatory-biology-group.html">
Computational Trans-Regulatory Biology</a> group at Charles Perkins Centre (CPC), the University of Sydney, 
and holds a conjoint appointment as Group Leader of Computational Systems Biology group at Children's Medical Research Institute (CMRI), 
at the Westmead Research Hub.<br><br>

Molecular trans-regulatory networks (TRNs) comprised of cell signalling, transcriptional, translational, and (epi)genomic regulations are 
central to health and disease. We develop computational and statistical models to reconstruct cell signalling, 
epigenomic/transcriptional, and proteomic networks, and characterise their cross-talk and trans-regulations in various 
cellular processes and systems. By integrating heterogeneous trans-omic data with the goal of generating testable hypotheses 
and predictions, we aim to tackle the following research questions:<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>How do different layers of regulations talk to each other in controlling stem cell fate?</li>
    <li>Can we accurately predict stem cell differentiation trajectories based on their TRNs?</li>
    <li>The mechanisms of stem/progenitor cells in establishing identities and making cell fate decisions</li>
</ul>

<b>Openings</b><br><br>

Our lab is multi-disciplinary and combines computer science, engineering, mathematics and statistics, and molecular biology for 
understanding and harnessing stem/progenitor cells for development and therapeutics.
<br><br>
We are setting up a new laboratory at Children's Medical Research Institute 
(CMRI) at the Westmead Research Hub. PhD and Honours candidates are welcome to join us and work on either 
'wet' (laboratory) or 'dry' (computational) projects (or both). 
<br><br>
Our group also holds 'dry' space in both Charles Perkins Centre (CPC) and School of Mathematics and Statistics (Carslaw Building), 
the University of Sydney. Candidates whose background are in computer science, engineering, and/or mathematics and statistics are
welcome to join us and select their preferred research location(s).
<br><br>
PhD Scholarships are available for international candidates. Summer Research Scholarships are available for third year undergraduates. For more details regarding scholarships, please contact Dr. Pengyi Yang (<a href="mailto:pengyi.yang@sydney.edu.au">pengyi.yang [at] sydney.edu.au</a>)
