<p>The Bioinformatics research group at MCRI focuses on statistical bioinformatics and computational biology. We work on analysis methods for high-throughput sequencing and microarrays and we are involved in many collaborative projects.</p>

<p>
Our research focuses include:
<ul>
    <li>Analysis of RNA-seq data</li>
    <li>Epigenetic analysis including:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>DNA methylation microarrays</li>
        <li>ChIP-seq analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Detecting disease causing variants in the human genome using high-throughput sequencing technologies.</li>
</ul>
