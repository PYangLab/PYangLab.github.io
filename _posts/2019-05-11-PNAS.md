  Our work on "scMerge leverages factor analysis, stable expression, and pseudoreplication to merge multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets" is published in <b><i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i></b>.
 

### Abstract

Concerted examination of multiple collections of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data promises further biological insights that cannot be uncovered with individual datasets. Here we present scMerge, an algorithm that integrates multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets using factor analysis of stably expressed genes and pseudoreplicates across datasets. Using a large collection of public datasets, we benchmark scMerge against published methods and demonstrate that it consistently provides improved cell type separation by removing unwanted factors; scMerge can also enhance biological discovery through robust data integration, which we show through the inference of development trajectory in a liver dataset collection.
