Multiple sources have picked up our work on <b>Intragenic enhancers attenuate host gene expression</b>. 
These include <i>Nature Reviews Genetics</i> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrg.2017.90">[fulltext]</a> and 
<i>Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology</i> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrm.2017.111">[fulltext]</a>.<br>

Multiple members from the group have also been interviewed by NIH to summarise our work to the public.
