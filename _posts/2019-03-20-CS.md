### Abstract

HIGHLIGHTS

·     Multi-ome maps of ESCs transitioning from naïve to primed pluripotency

·     Phosphoproteome dynamics precede changes to epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome

·     ERK signaling is dispensable beyond the initial phase of exit from naïve pluripotency

·     Comparative analysis of mouse and human naïve and primed pluripotent states
 
eTOC

Cell signaling underlies transcriptional and/or epigenetic control of a vast majority of cell fate decisions during early embryonic development. Yet, the sequence of molecular events that underlie the developmental transformation of pre-implantation epiblast to post-implantation epiblast remain poorly understood. Through comprehensive mapping of the proteome, phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and epigenome of embryonic stem cells transitioning from naïve to primed pluripotency, Yang et al. shed new insights on the multi-layered control of the phased progression of pluripotency.
