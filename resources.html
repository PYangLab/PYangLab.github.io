     	Kinase perturbation analysis (KinasePA) is a web tool that allows you to identify key kinases that are 
     	perturbed in two treatments compared to a control condition.
        <br><br>
        Description: <br>
     	The input data should be a csv file separated by comma. The rows of the data file are phosphorylation 
     	sites and the columns are treatment1 vs control and treatment2 vs control. The values of the data file 
     	should be log2 fold changes. Please download this file as an example for required data format: [exampleData] 
     	(right click and save). The same data is loaded into KinasePA when it is initiated for demonstrating its function.
     	<br><br>
     	KinasePA has also been incorporate into "directPA" R package. Install the package and find out more:<br>
     	install.packages("directPA")

     	PUEL is an implementation of positive-unlabeled ensemble learning model for kinase-substrate prediction using
     	kinase recognition motifs and dynamic phosphoproteomics data.

     	Prediction results for Akt, mTOR, AMPK, and ERK from different organisms using large-scale phosphoproteomics data
     	are available from <a href="http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/pengyi/software/PUEL.html">here</a>
