        <div class="content">
            This is a major initiative in our group to integrate trans-omics dataset generated from mouse embryonic stem cells
            (mESCs) differentiation process. The goal is to investigate the cross-talk of signalling cascades, epigenomic,
            transcriptomic and proteomic regulation, and there feedback regulations.
            The high-throughput data that are are seeking to integrate include time-course mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics, RNA-seq,
            and ChIP-seq data.

        <div class="content">
            We are working closely with Prof. Jean Yang's group on mixture modelling from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. This include
            developing novel statistical model to capture various unique aspects in scRNA-seq data. We are applying our model
            to understand cell differentiation and tissue development processes in human and mouse.

        <div class="content">
            We have recently developed an adaptive sampling approach for learning from positive-unlabeled dataset. 
            We are extending this semi-supervised learning approach for the identification of transcription factor target
            genes in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data.

        <div class="content">
            The understanding of fat tissue formation is critical for treating various metabolic and obesity related diseases.
            In collaboration with Prof. David James lab, we have developed several machine learning approach to elucidate the
            signaling cascades in fat cells (Humphrey et al. 2013 Cell Metab.). We are planning for global profiling of the 
            fat cell differentiation process to understand the trans-omic networks underlying this process 
            using various statistical modelling approaches. You will get involved in developing key statistical models to
            integrate trans-omics data and infer their feedback regulation during the maturation process of fat cells.

        <div class="content">
			The advance of ultrafast sequencing (ChIP-seq) allows the profiling of transcription factor (TF) binding sites 
			genome-wide in a cell. The massive amount of sequencing data generated from these genome-wide profiling of TF 
			requires sophisticated computational algorithm to be developed for accurately identifying TF binding sites.
			Deep learning is the latest development in machine learning that has been successfully utilised to address 
			many bioinformatics applications. In this project, we aim to develop and apply deep learning models for 
			predicting TF binding sites by integrating ChIP-seq data with other biological knowledge. 
			This project aims to develop and apply cutting-edge deep learning algorithms for solving a key biological problem. 
			You will get involved in all aspects of the development including algorithm design, implementation and testing.
