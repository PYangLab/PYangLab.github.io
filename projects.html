        <h3 class="heading">Project 1: Reconstructing trans-regulatory networks by trans-omic data integration</h3>
        <div class="content">
            A major initiative in our group is to integrate trans-omics datasets generated by state‐of‐the‐art mass spectrometer (MS) and next 
			generation sequencer (NGS) from various cell systems.
            The goal is to reconstruct trans-regulatory networks and to understand how different regulatory machineries (e.g. signalling, transcription, and epigenomics) 
            co-operate to define cell states, functions, and fates.<br><br>
            
            We have previously developed various computational methods to integrate the multi-layered trans‐omics datasets generated during naive to formative pluripotency transition 
            in ESCs (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.03.012">Yang et al. 2019</a>). Our current research project 
			aims to further this study by developing methods to characterise signaling cascades, transcriptional networks, and translational protein networks and their cross‐talks. 
			This project will provide a unique opportunity for developing computational methods for comprehensive understanding of cell systems and their decision-making process.

       <div class="content">
            The understanding of fat tissue formation is critical for treating various metabolic and obesity related diseases.
            In collaboration with Prof. David James lab, we have developed several machine learning approaches to elucidate the
            signaling cascades in fat cells (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv550">Yang et al. 2016</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004403">Yang et al. 2015</a>;
			<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cmet.2013.04.010">Humphrey et al. 2013</a>). We are planning for global profiling of the 
            fat cell (3T3-L1) differentiation process to understand the trans-omic networks underlying this process 
            using various statistical modelling approaches. You will get involved in developing key statistical models to
            integrate trans-omics data and infer their feedback regulation during the maturation process of fat cells (i.e. adipogenesis).

      <h3 class="heading">Project 3: Stem/progenitor cell differentiation and iPSC reprogramming</h3>
      <div class="content">
        The ability of stem/progenitor to self-renew and differentiate into specialised cell types in the body makes them the key cellular tools for stem cell-based therapy, 
        whereby any specific cell populations, tissues, and organs compromised by disease, injury or ageing can be replaced and replenished indefinitely. 
        While tremendous progress has been made in stem cell therapy, attempts to direct stem/progenitor cells to clinically useful cell types have often been fraught with 
        imprecise and incomplete differentiation, a common cause of tumorigenesis, owing to a lack of comprehensive understanding of trans-regulatory networks 
        that underline cell identities and cell-fate decisions.<br><br>
        
        Leveraging on the recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), this project aims for profiling the trans-regulatory networks stem/progenitor
        using trans-omics. Complementary to this, we will also profile the trans-regulatory networks during somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This
        data will allow us to model and subsequently modulate trans-regulatory networks for highly precise stem/progenitor differentiation for use in stem cell-based therapy.

        <div class="content">
			Deep learning is the latest development in machine learning that has been successfully utilised to address 
			many bioinformatics applications. We are interested in its application such as in transcription factor (TF)
			binding site identification and target gene prediction.<br><br>
			
			The advance in chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by ultrafast sequencing (ChIP-seq) allows the profiling of TF binding sites 
			genome-wide in a population of cells. The massive amount of sequencing data generated from these genome-wide profiling of TF 
			requires sophisticated computational algorithms to be developed for accurately identifying TF binding sites.
			In this project, we aim to develop and apply deep learning models for 
			predicting TF binding sites by integrating ChIP-seq data with other biological knowledge. 
			This project aims to develop and apply cutting-edge deep learning algorithms for solving a key biological problem.
			You will get involved in all aspects of the development including algorithm design, implementation and testing.

        <h3 class="heading">Project 4: Pathway reconstruction and annotation using statistical models and trans-omics data sets</h3>
        <div class="content">		
			While all cells from a given organism have the same DNA sequence that codes for the same genes, 
			different cell types of that organism only have a subset of genes “turned on”. 
			Genes are commonly annotated into pathways for summarising their collective effect in the biological systems. 
			One of the main drawbacks in current pathway annotation is that they are NOT cell type-specific.<br><br>
			
			We propose to identify and curate cell type-specific pathways, for example, in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using the
			trans-omics datasets. The key assumption is that genes within a pathway should have correlated expression profile changes when perturbed.
			We have collected ESC differentiation data profiled in a time-course on both proteome and transcriptome levels. 
			Following the above assumption, we aim to (1) identify pathways that are regulated specifically in ESC differentiation; 
			and (2) curate ESC-specific pathways using statistical learning. 
			This project will expose you to the development and application of cutting-edge statistical 
			learning methods to the state-of-the-art bio-molecular applications. It sits at the heart of the interdisciplinary research conducted in our group.
