            <br><br>

            For postgraduate applicants, all 'wet' projects require experience with cell culturing and good understanding of basic experimental protocols (e.g. qPCR, westernblotting) and preferably experience of (single cell-)sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. All 'dry' projects require programming skill in at least one programming/scripting language (R, Perl, Python, Java, C++, C and Matlab). There are ample opportunity to work closely with biologists, statisticians, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists.
